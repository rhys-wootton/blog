Hi there! My name is Rhys Wootton, and I am an undergraduate currently completing a Computer Science with Cyber Security MSci degree in the heart of London at City University.

This blog is to serve as a place I can talk about anything that I find interesting enough to share with the world. I hope you enjoy it!
