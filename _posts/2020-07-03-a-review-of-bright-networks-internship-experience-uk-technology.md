*Before I go into my review of the whole event, I want to give a huge shoutout to a girl that made a massive notes document and shared it on Google Drive for us all to see. I was making my own notes anyways, but it was helpful to compare with hers and see what I had missed, and I did like the nice Thor meme that was at the top of the document. I cannot remember her name, but if anyone knows please let me know, I would like to send her a message on LinkedIn!*

So, Miss Rona is still here (no she has not gone), and because of that, many internships and placements have been either cancelled, postponed or reduced to an online one that is not giving the full experience to students. I did not have anything planned over the summer anyways, I will be looking to do stuff following second year, but a few weeks back I received an email from someone in my school’s ‘Professional Liaison Unit’. The email was about a virtual internship experience being run by Internships Experience UK (I’ll be calling them IEUK from now on as that is too long to type), Bright Network and Guardian Jobs across 6 sectors: Business, Finance, Banking, Tech, Law and Consulting. Immediately I was drawn to the Tech one and thought why not sign up and see if I get offered a place on it.

Signing up was easy. It asked for my university, what I am studying, my course completion year, and to write up to a 100-word essay on why this would be beneficial. My A-Level Art & Design skills come into play here, knowing how write “as it will be beneficial for me to gain skills for the future” in about 80 odd words. Alas, around a week later I got an email telling me I secured a place on the virtual internship experience, and I was chuffed. Not only would it give me something to do for a few days, but it was something useful rather than spending 4 hours on why a small piece of code wont run than then just playing Mario Kart Wii for the rest of the day.

This post is going to be my personal thoughts and feelings about the virtual internship experience, both good and bad, and what I was able to get out of the three-day event.

### Day 1 – A load of talks

The event started at 9am, but I was up at around 7:30am to get myself looking “dapper” (more like presentable). I had a shower, used some John Frieda Frizz Ease Extreme Curls so my hair wasn’t just a frizz ball of curls (not a sponsor by the way, don’t come for me), trimmed up my beard, slapped on a shirt and tie and even just put on some foundation to make my face not look red and blotchy. I was ready for the first 30 minutes of the event, the 1:1 networking. Prior to this I was getting a bucket load of connections on LinkedIn, which was nice to see, along with some messages from people, but I wanted to try and meet more people through video chat. Turns out for some reason Hopin, the platform they used, said “computer says no” to me, and it never bloody worked. It was probably something to do on my end, but I do not know what. I even turned my ad blocker off (uOrigin you are excellent by the way, not sponsored either), but that did nothing except annoy me when watching YouTube to see ads showing up again because I forgot to turn it back on. Not to worry though, as three of my university mates were also doing this event, so we all hopped on a Discord video chat and just chilled out and caught up there before all the talks began.

#### Networking (Kelly Hoey) and ‘Managing You’ (Ben Carter) seminars

We started off with a seminar on Networking by Kelly Hoey, an author, speaker, and networking expert (according to her website). I must give it to her, she was highly enthusiastic and engaging considering it was 5:30 in for morning for her when she was speaking to us, so fair play! She really emphasised that networking is all about the ‘Three P’s of Networking – PEOPLE, PEOPLE and PEOPLE’. Networking is all about people, and about the human activity that you have with people. She went on to tell us that we need to consistently be keeping in contact with our existing networks and new contacts, but always be focusing on our peer network who are currently living the same experiences that we are. I found this to be some great advice, as it is very easy to always fall back on people you already know, but they may or may not have already lived the experience you are having at the moment, and they will not be as helpful as someone who is currently having the same problems and experiences. Sadly, just before her portion of the talk ended, her video froze.

Our second seminar was about managing ourselves from Ben Carter, a Growth & Innovation Manager at Bright Network. He really focused on having good self-management skills through organisation and having initiative to figure out problems on your own without having to always rely on someone else. He also gave good points on having a good work-life balance and to make sure you create clear boundaries between your work life and personal life, which I think a lot of us struggle with.

Both talks were very informative and were a great way to start this virtual internship experience in my opinion. They covered a wide range of open-ended topics that allowed us to then focus on the key skilled talks that were going to happen later in the day.

#### Sector 101: Introduction to Technology – Accenture (Emmanuel Ihenacho & Donna Cummings)

For our introduction to technology talk, we got a 30-minute work life story from Emmanuel Ihenacho, a Senior Manager at Accenture Technology, about all his previous work experience from starting at Serena Software all the way to now working for Accenture. Honestly, for an ‘Introduction to Technology’ talk, that only come into play for the last 20 minutes of the talk. Whilst it was nice to learn about what jobs he has had and what jobs you can have, in my eyes there was not a lot to learn about how to get into the technology sector. We were told that we need to have a good qualification to get into the industry, and told stuff like thinking outside the box, knowing some programming languages etc. but I honestly believe any tech graduate a quick Google search could have told you that. One piece of good advice, however, was to research the company that employs you, and that you have a solid understanding of the way they work and their morals. There were also some polls that we were given which added some nice interaction from the audience, I guess.

#### Managing Complexity – Google (Georgina Hetherington & Katherin Schuler)

We learnt a lot about the inner workings of Google here, but at the same time the information they were telling us was very useful. We got to learn about Google’s core values of creating products that everyone can use, and that they really focus on putting their employees into teams that allow them to work the best they can, for as they said, “maximum efficiency”. We also learnt that Google gives all their employees 20% of their time to work on personal projects, which I think is cool. I know how draining it can be working on a project 24/7. Making a website and a game for two modules really put me off coding for a little while afterwards, but now I am able to work on personal projects that I enjoy doing, it has brought it back to life for me. This goes back to me not having a work-life balance though, so I am the only one to blame for that!

#### Verification and Testing - Goldman Sachs (Raj Patel)

Best talk of the day hands down. I loved this one as it was full on knowledge being thrown at us in a way that we could all understand, even non-STEM students, and Raj hardly plugged the fact that he worked for Goldman Sachs! We were told about all the types of testing that companies will go through before publishing their code, along with example tools that can do this. We also got to learn about terms such as ‘code coverage’ and things like testing pyramids. He was very engaging the entire time, and this was the talk that I got the most notes for, so a massive thumbs up from me!

#### Communication and Collaboration -Bloomberg (Alissa Garland, Sophie Robinson, Andrea Valencia)

This, on the other hand, felt like a sales pitch from Bloomberg for us to come and work for them. We learnt about their core values, the lifecycle that their products have, their many departments and a whole lot about the reliability of their data within the Bloomberg terminal. They went into some detail about how these different departments communicate and collaborate, but I feel like they could have had more than one slide showing their department break down, and gone through a real world example with slides to keep us engaged rather than trying to explain their whole timeline through words.

#### Creative Problem Solving and Design - Amazon (Ryan Little)

As someone who does not know a whole lot about the world of cloud computing, this talk was a great introduction into it. We learnt about what the cloud is on a basic surface level, and Ryan used AWS as an example which was useful, as it allowed me understand what he was talking about and apply it to a real world situation. Some interesting statistics such as “80% of enterprise IT will move whole infrastructure into the cloud by 2025” and that “94% of workforce data will be in the cloud by 2021” shows the importance of cloud computing in our current age. I know that I will have to deal with cloud computing in my future careers, so getting a small glimpse into it now was very helpful.

#### Agile Software Development -Vodafone (Anthony Palm)

Anthony telling us right of the bat that he used to be a professional gamer in Dota was a great way to get all the STEM gamers to watch closely, and it worked. He spoke about how Vodafone goes through development using the agile method, though his explanations were highly technical, and as such non-STEM students were struggling to understand what was being said (which could be seen in the chat on the right-hand side of the screen). However, a quick Google search lands you to a great page by Atlassian which explains it all very nicely.

### Day 2: Let us get to work!

We start of the day by being introduced to the work sample that we will be completing. This work sample links closely to all the talks that were given the day prior, and we were expected to apply the knowledge we had gained to complete this task. “Our task, what was it?” you may be asking. Well, let Bright Network explain:

> You've recently begun working as a Product Manager for a large UK Bank. A Senior Executive has asked you to plan the release of Facial Verification into the customer banking app sign-in process.  You have joined the Senior Executive in the Design Sprint to gather the project requirements and the scoped user stories planned for the first iteration. After an initial market review, you have found that there are no 'off the shelf products that are suitable and so you need to build the feature in-house.  Using what you have learned, break down the new feature into user stories, and create a plan for its build, testing, and release, using two teams.

We were given the task to create a report containing the following requirements:

* A one-page summary, including:
  * A high-level project summary showcasing the overall aim of the project and what a successful project would look like.
  * Key feature and security considerations / risks to be aware of with facial verification technology.
  * Core user Experience considerations for the design of the feature.
* A one-page user story summary, including:
  * The top user stories that you believe would have come out of the Design Sprint that will be required when building the facial verification software for the app.
  * A breakdown of the user stories into Sprints to inform your project planning.
  * The inclusion of each user stories level of difficulty and its acceptance criteria.
* A one-page project management plan of how the feature will be created, including:
  * The rough guide to the team you will require for the build and what their roles would be.
  * A release plan considering the software development cycle and the sprints required for completion.
* A one-page communications plan, including the different stakeholders involved and how you plan to minimise the project's complexity.

This meant that we were expected to research the current markets that are using facial verification within mobile apps and devices, and then use this research to create a project management plan that would take us from concept to release. Overall, I found this project highly enjoyable, and I approached the project in a different way to what the Bright Network team did, which was able to show me the different ways of solving the problem that we were given. I will link my final presentation down below for you to look at if you wish to do so.

We also had a talk at the end of the day from Ben Carter about teamwork and collaboration, but I was really tired after working for around 5 hours straight on research and coming up with a plan to solve this problem. I did capture some notes, but I do not feel like it is fair to give an opinion on this talk as I was not fully invested in it. Sorry Ben!

### Day 3: The final countdown

We had 2 hours (9am-11am) to finish off the work sample, which I used to double check over my whole report. I uploaded my report to Google Drive and waited for the ‘Welcome and debrief’ talk to begin.

Once the talk began, they went through their work sample, which was packed with information and explained each of the parts that made it a good and thorough submission. After they went through this, they told us to go into 1:1 networking and peer mark our reports. Remember, Hopin does not like me for some reason, so my university mates and I decided to all get back on a call and present our reports to each other, and one of us marks each other and gives feedback on them. Once we did that and submitted our marks, we all sat there relieved that we were done with the work, and all congratulated each other for doing a good job.

#### Tech CV Workshop, Google (Georgina Hetherington)

Georgia returned one final time to give us a talk on how to have a great CV that employers will love. This talk was excellent in my opinion. My current CV is quite a mess, however her guide was really useful into seeing how I can simply restructure and change some parts of my CV around to get an amazing outcome that employers will be pleased to look at.

One of the main points that come out of her talk was a formula that was created by the former head of her department (I forgot his name), which was `Accomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]`. This I think was a brilliant way to think about how to let employers know about what I have done to show them I am a brilliant candidate. She also mentioned the use of metrics throughout an entire CV so employers can really understand how you contributed to a project or previous role.

### Some final thoughts

Do I think that Bright Network’s IEUK was worth it? Absolutely. I have gained some valuable skills by doing this virtual internship experience. I have learnt about how workplaces in the technology sector function to produce products that consumers will use, and the different factors that will make someone employable for one of these companies. The work sample was an enjoyable task and pushed me to create a fully flushed out report within a deadline, which is what would be expected in a real-life situation.

Do I think that some things could be improve? Of course. The platform is not the best in my eyes, especially since the 1:1 networking just did not work for me at all. The video would also become blurry at times, making it hard to read what was on screen, though that of course could be down to several factors outside of people’s control. Some of the talks as I have mentioned could have also been adapted, but since this is the first type of event of its kind, there of course will be kinks that need to be ironed out, and improvements can be made for future events like this.

Overall, I believe what they offered was outstanding and something that I will value for years to come. I would like to thank Bright Network for hosting the event over the three days, and all the companies that participated for the talks. And if you have made it all the way to the end, thank you for reading!
