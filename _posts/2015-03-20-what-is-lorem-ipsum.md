title: "Well hello there!"

Hello there people. This is my first ever blog post. Kind of crazy to think it has taken me this long to start one since I have been wanting to write one for years, but here we are now! I am planning to make this a hub for all things that interest me, and things that I want to take time writing about. Writing is something that I have always enjoyed doing but I have never found a way that I could link it to my love of code, but now I think I have found a way. 

### So why did I start this?

I only found out a few days ago that GitHub gives all of it users a free way to turn [repositories into websites](https://pages.github.com/). I immediately thought of things I could do, and landed on the idea of making a personal portfolio. I've seen people do this for a while, and now that I am in university and am gearing up to look for internships and placements in the next 12 months, I think it would be a great way for me to showcase not only my talents and skills, but also my own personality. 

Being able to share my personality though this I think is key. With the people I see on my course wanting to become developers for massive corporations, all they focus on is being able to code really quick or slap programs together in a day or two, and not show even a glimpse of what they are as a person. It's easy to learn about the fastest way to solve an algorithm that might come up in an interview, but that is only a small part of it. When it comes to asking more personal questions, I want to be able to share my experiences outside of this computer science bubble. 

When I tell people I am studying computer science, I'll usually get asked questions like "So do you sit at your computer all day and code?" Yes, I do sit at my computer for most of the day, but coding 24/7 would make me want to smack my head against a wall. I like to play video games, watch YouTube videos, read up on current world affairs, learn about new technology being developed, etcetera. My life isn't just sitting at a computer typing lines of code until I can no longer function, that is so boring. 

So, that's why this has come to life. I want to share things I am doing, both computer science related and not. I'm not expecting to be uploading a new post everyday, but I will try to be writing a few posts a week about what I am finding interesting at the moment.

Thanks for taking the time to read this small introduction, and I hope to see you soon!
