**Yep, I am an idiot to say the least.**

I just got back home from my student accommodation at the end of February before we were locked down because of *Coronavirus*, *COVID-19*, *Miss Rona*, whatever you want to call it. I unpacked all my essentials, shoved stuff in bags I didn’t need under my bed until I move out again, and quickly began setting up my desktop PC. It had been around 10 months since I had used it. I didn’t take it to my accommodation, I just used my laptop and hooked it up to two monitors as a bootleg desktop per say. I was so excited to be using it again, I love the desktop I built. It is getting quite old now (I built it at the end of 2016, it is need of an upgrade), but it is still my pride and joy.

I booted it up and noticed right off the bat it was a bit sluggish. Mind you it hadn’t been turned on for around 10 months, so it was probably grabbing updates left right and centre. I was planning to reset it back to a clean install anyways, I usually do that once a year to get rid of all the clutter that builds up on there when I installed that program I needed one time but never used again (I’m looking at you **Speccy**). However, before I reset, I had always remembered to backup a VERY important file, my Windows 8 Pro product key Word document.

If you don’t know, when Windows 8 was released back in like 2012, they did a promotion where you could buy a copy of Windows 8 Pro for something like £25. I begged my parents for weeks prior to its release asking for a copy, since it was getting released around my birthday. Yes I asked for a Windows product key as a birthday present, I can see you judging through your screen right now. I know I was a very “interesting” child, but aren’t we all a bit quirky? Anyhow, my dad bought it, and then he received an email with the key in a Word document. Since that time, every laptop and desktop I have had, I keep a copy of this file in my documents (it was password protected so don’t come for me) just in case I need it for something. Well today was this day, and that is where \*\*\*\* hit the fan.

### Where’s that \*\*\*\*\*\*\* product key document?”

Good question Rhys. Little did I know that when I reset my desktop back in February, I forgot to back this file up. You might now be asking “But Rhys, you said you keep it on all your laptops and desktops, so you must have it somewhere else right?” No. I don’t. You want to know why?

* I used to have a Surface Pro before I gave it to my dad. I reset it and thought I wouldn’t need the product key document from there as it was on my desktop.
* I upgraded from that to a Lenovo laptop. The drive on that failed after like 2 odd years, just after my support ended (very convenient Lenovo…). Can’t get anything off that laptop now, including the product key document.
* My current laptop, a Dell XPS 15, doesn’t have the file on there as I thought “I can just type it out from my desktop, I wont be using this desktop for much longer anyways as I’m going off to uni so it can stay safe on there”.

So that is the issue. The only place it was, my desktop, I deleted it from. This is a big problem as I am doing both testing for an app I am planning to release soon-ish, and because I want to do some online courses that require a virtual machine running Windows. I thought “perfect, I have that key file, and a digital license for my Microsoft account, this should be easy!” Oh, how I was so wrong. The digital license only applies to the devices that you have used the key on. So, for now, that is both my desktop and my laptop, not the virtual machine. It is lucky that I have that available so if I plan on upgrading my desktop, I can still activate that machine perfectly fine.

And yes, I have tried using programs such as Recuva to no avail. After 4 months that data has been overwritten for sure on my hard drive. I have completely lost the key.

So, what is realistically my only option. I am not forking out £119 for the Home version, and most certainly not £229 for the Pro version (them prices are insane). I will have to reinstall my virtual machine every 30 days, which isn’t a massive deal as I can back-up the data and just shove it back onto the virtual machine. It will just be a bit more time consuming, but that is the price I pay for being a clown.

If there is one thing you can get out of this, have off-site backups on a different drive or cloud hosted. You will not then cause the same mistakes I have. This makes me wonder how I am on a Computer Science course, but hey, worse things have happened to more important people. It will teach me to be more careful in the future.
